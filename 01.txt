With globalization, financial crises have also started to globalize, which has given rise to making more sound investments in the financial sector, improving regulations, and taking measures to sustain the system's functioning. Increasing direct consumption and investment expenditures through credit expansion, one of the most popular tools of today's economic policies, contributes to the natural increase in national income. On the other hand, reaching broader masses due to the increase in product diversity and the financial literacy in the financial sector reinforces the importance and contribution of the financial system to the economy. Moreover, crisis periods, the last global financial crisis, and macroeconomic instabilities have&nbsp;increased&nbsp;the&nbsp;interest&nbsp;in&nbsp;the link&nbsp;between finance-growth-inequality-poverty.</p><p>Therefore, it is essential to consider the connection between financial sector development, income inequality, and poverty alleviation. Financial systems play a potentially important role in equalizing economic opportunities and reducing disparities in the literature. However, if a particular segment is advantageous to the poor in terms of access to financial services, financial development may not&nbsp; reduce income inequality.</p><p>The study aims to examine the effect of financial development and growth on income inequality, in other words, to investigate whether it contributes to poverty alleviation from the perspective of countries with insufficient capital accumulation and to make policy recommendations in line with the analysis.
